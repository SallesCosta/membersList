# Members List

## How can I start the project?

it's not difficult. Follow the steps:

1. Clone this repository,

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SallesCosta/membersList.git
```

2. Once inside the directory, you must run `yarn`
and wait a few seconds until the project dependencies are installed.

3. Then run `yarn dev`, go to [localhost](http://localhost:3000) and <i>voil√†!</i>

4. In `./members-list/api/` directory and run `yarn dev` to start a backend/API simulation to provide the data.

In this project you can find some users and their public information.
Not all data from the users may be available, but you have the phone and the e-mail. We can contact them directly.


# Basic Usage 

You only have to write the name in the input-text, if there is a user with that name it will be displayed.
Each user has a profile that shows their information by clicking on the respective card.
Or you can filter the Api`s datas by State in the FilterSection (left side).

A maximum of 9 users will be displayed at a time, but all are accessible, just use Pagination, which will appear below the list of users.


Any questions? Any suggestions? We can talk about.
